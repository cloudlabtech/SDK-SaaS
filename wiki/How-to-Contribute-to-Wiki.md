# How to Contribute to Wiki Pages
A good starting point of learning how to contribute to any open-source project can be found in the [first contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) guide of the **firstcontributions** github project.

You can contribute with the wiki pages by doing the following:
1. Clone the Wiki repository to a local repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/cloudlabtech/SDK.wiki.git`
2. Create a personal fork of the project `SDK-SaaS` on Github
3. Clone your forked repository on the branch main
4. On your forked repository, create a new branch named `contrib`. You'll use this branch to commit your changes and compare to pull request against the `SDK-SaaS` repository
5. Do all the changes you want from your `SDK.wiki` local repository markdown files
6. Copy all changed files you have made from the `SDK.wiki` project to your forked `SDK-SaaS` repository inside the folder `wiki` of the branch `contrib` you had created earlier
5. Create a Pull Request from your forked repository for the `contrib` branch of the `SDK-SaaS` repository
6. Done!
